# Skin-Cancer-Detection
Skin Cancer Detection model is made using HAM10000 Dataset.
A portion of it is utilized for training, while the rest is used to validate and test the model.
The collection has a total of 10015 photos with a resolution of 600 x 450 pixels. 
We have used CNN to train hundreds of skin cancer photos, and as a result, the model will be able to categorizes an unknown image into one of the seven skin cancer classes. We have built our CNN using 13 layers in this model. Convolutional layers, Max Pooling layers, Dropout layers, and Dense layers are among the 20 layers. Figure 6 depicts all of the details, including the layer's shape and number of parameters, as well as the total.
CNN model can be successfully used to detect the skin cancer. This model has proven to be 76% accurate, it can be used by dermatologist to detect the skin cancer in few seconds which can help us save the precious life all around the world.
